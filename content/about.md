I am a passionate data science enthusiast and a fresher in the field, eager to apply my knowledge and skills to real-world projects. With a strong foundation in data analysis, machine learning, and natural language processing (NLP), I am excited about the possibilities that data science offers in solving complex problems.

My technical skills include Python, SQL, statistical analysis, machine learning, NLP, and data visualization. I have gained hands-on experience in various projects, some of which are highlighted below:

1. [BERT-Based Sentiment Analysis of Online Class App Feedback](https://github.com/Aravinth-Megnath/NLP-Project/tree/main)
   - Developed a deep learning model for sentiment analysis of online class app feedback using BERT.
   - Achieved 84% accuracy by focusing on high precision for positive sentiments and high recall for negative sentiments.

2. [Crab Age Prediction](https://github.com/Aravinth-Megnath/Crab_age)
   - Developed a machine learning model to predict the age of crabs based on physical characteristics.
   - Achieved an R-squared value of 0.59 using the random forest regression algorithm.

3. [Delivery Cost Analysis & Billing Discrepancy Detection](https://github.com/Aravinth-Megnath/Data-analysis-project--Delivery-cost/tree/main)
   - Built a Python-based system for analyzing delivery costs and detecting billing discrepancies in e-commerce companies.
   - Utilized Pandas and Numpy for data cleaning and analysis, resulting in reduced operational costs.
